I have worked closely with C-level executives on strategy and business transformation projects.

My achievements include:

- Overseeing the $400MM USD network expansion of a regional North American telecommunications provider while working at the client headquarters. This was done by running a Monte Carlo optimization which identified the optimal network layout that would maximize profits based on a customer lifetime value model.
- Generating $9MM USD in cost savings for a US manufacturing company through on-site strategic sourcing and vendor contract renegotiation.
- Driving client sales lift by up to 13% by developing and executing automated media optimization algorithms that optimize media spending for sales instead of traditional metrics such as reach.
