I have a proven track record of applying predictive modeling and mathematical optimization concepts to come up with actionable solutions to real life problems, helping organizations take advantage of the opportunities opened up by the rise of the data age.

My achievements include:

- Launching and managing the Asian analytics hub to handle the data management, statistical modeling, and mathematical optimization needs of a global media conglomerate across its agencies worldwide.
- Guiding the $400MM USD network expansion of a regional North American telecommunications provider by running a Monte Carlo optimization which identified the optimal network layout that would maximize profits based on a customer lifetime value model.
- Driving client sales lift of up to 13% by developing and executing automated media optimization algorithms.
- Developing an automated flu tracker to guide the Australian marketing campaign schedule for a leading FMCG company's cough and flu medication.
- Successfully predicting the winner of the 2016 Philippine presidential elections using an econometric model six months before the election.
