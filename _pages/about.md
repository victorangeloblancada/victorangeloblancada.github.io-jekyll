## About Me

I am a data science expert with a strong background in strategy consulting. I specialize in providing best possible solutions to business decision-makers using big data analytics. My technical experience across the entire data and analytics pipeline – from data management to quantitative analysis (using mathematical modeling and optimization) to results presentation to stakeholders – covers a wide range of industries from telecommunications to fast-moving consumer goods.

In my present capacity working for a global supply chain management company, I am responsible for optimizing global operations by developing data-driven solutions and introducing self-service machine learning-based tools and processes that help promote the company’s competitive advantage and drive strategic business growth.

As Analytics Technology Manager for a leading media conglomerate, I pioneered its global predictive modeling hub and was responsible for optimizing the media portfolios of global brands, i.e., helping clients effectively meet sales targets with customized media portfolio optimization solutions.

An experienced strategy consultant for Fortune 500 companies, I have worked with C-level clients across a variety of industries to formulate innovative data-driven solutions for their businesses, leading high-performance teams that deliver their advanced analytics requirements.
