## About Me

I am a data science and machine learning expert with a strong background in strategy consulting. I specialize in providing best possible solutions to business decision-makers using big data analytics. My technical experience across the entire data and analytics pipeline – from data engineering to machine learning to results presentation to stakeholders – covers a wide range of industries from telecommunications to marketing and advertising to supply chain management.
