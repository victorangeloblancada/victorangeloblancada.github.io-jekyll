			</center>

			<div class="content">
				<div class="article">
					<ul>
						<li>Directed the $400MM USD network expansion of a North American telecommunications carrier by running a predictive big data simulation that leveraged a terabyte-scale database to forecast sales on the customer level and developed a detailed network plan with specifications down to last-mile connections to customer premises.</li>
						<li>Generated client sales lift of up to 13% by creating a large-scale media portfolio optimization program that was used across the Asia Pacific. The algorithm used was custom-built to accommodate large and complex problems such as multiple year cross-market and cross-portfolio optimization of media assets at a weekly level.</li>
						<li>Developed an automated flu-tracker that predicts flu incidence based on variables such as weather and search interest to help schedule marketing campaigns for cold and flu medicine. The flu-tracker was piloted across 5 markets in Australia and was subsequently rolled out to other Asia-Pacific countries.</li>
						<li>Successfully predicted the winning candidate in the 2016 Philippine national elections months before traditional analysis as part of a competitive analysis for a client political party. Self-developed econometric models used measured the effect of media and non-media factors on candidate popularity.</li> 
						<li>Improved user interactions in a chat bot app for a multinational insurance company using insights from natural language processing, resulting in an active user count increase of 73%.</li>
						<li>Spearheaded the data science and data engineering aspect of an analysis of social media user behavior over the Chinese New Year. This was published in the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/2135277/instagram-reveals-hong-kongs-chinese-new-year-winners-and" target="_blank">South China Morning Post.</a></li>
						<li>Improved the logistics efficiency of leading multinational sportswear brand by developing an SKU-level inventory prediction system for seasonal SKUs. The system uses K-Shape clustering to combine SKUs based on the shapes of their inventory curves before fitting regression models for each cluster.</li>
