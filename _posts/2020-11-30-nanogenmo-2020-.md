I participated in [National Novel Generation Month for 2020](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2020).  [See here](https://github.com/victorangeloblancada/nanogenmo-2020-vab) for my GitHub repository with my code and my final novel.

An excerpt of my novel can be found below:

> It was a sunny day.
>
> "I heard you have a pitch for me," the person demanded.
>
> The scriptwriter fidgeted before answering, "Yes, I do! So here's the story:"
>
> "Welcome to Micro Monarchy - Our hero, Kaison, is a Reverse Mole - A good guy who pretends to be on the villain's side. Kaison's story is this: Ridiculously convoluted plan. What stands in Kaison's way is Ephraim, a The Man In Front Of The Man - A minion of the apparent Big Bad is revealed to be the true villain. The turning point happens when: This is The Precarious Ledge. Throughout all of this, both Kaison and Ephraim have to deal with Hadley, a Ignorant Of The Call - Everyone considers the hero to be The Hero except for them."

> The producer crinkled his brow. "Come back again next time with something better."
