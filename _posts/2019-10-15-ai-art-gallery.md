This is a gallery of art that I generated through a variety of AI tools. Most of these were created using a [Google Colab notebook that I modified]( https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YXoU4K3wnGK4E06wWuWnqTdm0PQlzgkc ) from the [Neural Style Transfer with tf.keras seed](https://research.google.com/seedbank/seed/neural_style_transfer_with_tfkeras) in Colab seedbank.

Neural style transfer works by treating images as matrices of RGB pixels and using gradient descent to minimize the sum of content loss and style loss. In laymanâ€™s terms, machine learning is used to find the image that closely approximates the content of the source material while copying the style of another image.
